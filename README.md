# Yard
Handheld Programming Final Project: iOS yard sale app for college students

Class files found in Yard -> Classes. Main files found in Yard -> Controllers.

Yard uses firebase to connect graduating college students with potential buyers of their used furniture, textbooks, or miscellaneous items.
A user can post an item at a specific price, and another user can see this item on his or her feed and express interest,
sharing phone numbers and allowing the transaction to occur in person.
