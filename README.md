Handheld Programming Final Project: iOS yard sale app for college students

Class files found in Yard -> Classes. Main files found in Yard -> Controllers.

Many people in college move out of their rooms or their apartments in desperate need to sell their furniture, textbooks, clothes, or any other items they may not need the next year. Posting in the class facebook groups is often useless, and finding online sites to post your info, and then potentially having to package and ship your items is strenuous. Wouldn’t it be nice to advertise the items you are selling, and have fellow students come to you to purchase and pick up those items? Like a self-advertised yard-sale?

That’s where yard comes in. Meant for college students, and posts only visible to people within your college, yard allows users to post items and their price. Other students can proclaim interest, and the seller can send over his or her contact information so the transaction can be handled in person. This allows users to skip the lengthy credit card processing and shipping phase and go directly to the consumer. It also allows buyers to directly view and try the items they are thinking of purchasing.

This project was extremely time consuming. I think I spent over 60 hours on it. I learned so much in the process though, from firebase, to databases, to table view feeds, etc. This is why I never got to make it to the Android version. The past couple weeks, I have had to go home a couple times, but on top of that I really wanted to focus on making an app like this with a lot of features and somewhat good design. I hope you enjoy.
